## Component Library

*No formal component library is in place. The `index.html` file contains the basic UI elements.*

## Asset Management

*Assets such as fonts and icons are stored in the `src/ui` directory. Images are referenced from a local server.*

## Icon System

*The project uses the IcoMoon icon font, which is located in the `src/ui` directory.*

## Styling Approach

*The project uses Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework, and daisyUI. The layout should be responsive to different screen sizes.*

## Project Structure

*The project is organized into the following directories:*
*   `src/css`: Contains the CSS files.
*   `src/modules`: Contains the JavaScript modules.
*   `src/ui`: Contains the UI assets (fonts, icons).
