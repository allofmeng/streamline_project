## 5. Coding Reference

Current Working example is at /Users/markc/Documents/streamline_js/de1app/de1plus/skins/Streamline main functionality is written in skin.tcl , if you are not sure how to implement certain feature in Javascript, check aginst the logic in skin.tcl before you implement.

## 6. Current Goal

*   **What I'm working on:** "I would like to test out if tech stack works, I would like to have a simple html page connect to reaprime api and showing connection status and rendering real time data from decent espresso machine. "

## Gemini Added Memories
- When updating Plotly charts, use Plotly.update() instead of Plotly.react() for better performance.
